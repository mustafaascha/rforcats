**Another example**

Above, we learned about writing functions. Let's create a function to generate a markdown image link for a cute cat in various sizes (by pixels) from the website [placekitten.com](http://placekitten.com/). This is a awesome, but simple web service. You just use ask for the image size by adding two numbers at the end. For example, `http://placekitten.com/g/300/300` gives an image that is 300 by 300 pixels.

```{r, tidy=FALSE}
getcutecat <- function(x){
  writeLines(
    sprintf("![](http://placekitten.com/g/%s/%s)", x, x)
  )
}
```

300 pixels

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
getcutecat(300)
```

![some kittens](http://placekitten.com/g/300/300)

Here is some text to show that we can write things after images. 

250 pixels

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
getcutecat(250)
```

![some kittens](http://placekitten.com/g/250/250)

Here is some more text to show that we can write things after images.
